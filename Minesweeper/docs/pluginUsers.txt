Every plugin consists of the following module that are supposed to be used by users:

Configuration(Optional) - If it exists, it lets users configure the plugin in ways controlled by the plugin itself
The configuration module's located in plugins/configurations

===================================================================================================================

To load a plugin, open plugins.js in folder js/plugins
For any plugin, its declaration and implementation modules must be loaded in order for that plugin to work.
If that plugin has instructions on which of the remainings are optional/mandatory, then just follow them.
If there's no such instructions, then simply load all modules.
If a plugin has instructions on which plugins are required, please follow so.
Also, please note that if a plugin requires some other ones, then the former should be loaded after loading the
latters. This's done by placing the former below all the latters in the aforementioned plugins.js to be touched.
DON'T TOUCH ANY OTHER PARTS OF THAT plugins.js FILE UNLESS YOU REALLY KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TRULY DOING!
DON'T TOUCH ANY OTHER js FILES UNLESS YOU REALLY KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TRULY DOING!
