# HTML5-Chrome-Open-Source-Minesweeper
An amateurish personal side project for learning CSS, HTML5, Javascript and Minesweeper

Just download the whole project and open index.html in Minesweeper to play it!

On all js files, only cfg.js, plugins.js and those in the configurations folder are supposed to be edited by players.
